These options serve to compute candidate cell clusters, that can then be refined in the GUI. Clusters computed in the algorithm are split into connected regions and then classified as cell/non-cell based on the following

diameter --- % expected diameter of cells (used for 0.25 * pi/4*diam^2 < npixels < 10*pi/4*diam^2). Automatically sets MinNpix and MaxNpix below (1/4). 
MaxNpix --- maximum number of pixels per ROI. Automatically set by diameter, if provided. 
MinNpix --- minimum number of pixels per ROI. Automatically set by diameter, if provided. 
Compact --- a compactness criterion for how close pixels are to the center of the ROI. 1 is the lowest possible value, achieved by perfect disks. Best to leave this to a high value (i.e. 2) before the manual sorting stage. 
parent --- these are criteria imposed on the parent cluster (before separating connected regions). These are not currently used during the automated step, but are available in the GUI.
parent.minPixRelVar --- significant regions need to have at least >1/10 the mean variance of all regions
parent.MaxRegions --- if there are more non-significant regions than this number, this parent ROI is probably very spread out over many small components and its connected regions are not good cells: it will be discarded. 

Other (hidden) options are described in make_db_example.m, and at the top of run_pipeline.m (set to reasonable defaults), and get_signals_and_neuropil.m (neuropil "surround" option).
