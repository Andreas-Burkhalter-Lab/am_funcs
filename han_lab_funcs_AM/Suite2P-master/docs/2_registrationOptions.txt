showTargetRegistration --- whether to show an image of the target frame immediately after it is computed. 
PhaseCorrelation --- whether to use phase correlation (the alternative is normal cross-correlation).
SubPixel --- accuracy level of subpixel registration required. 2 is alignment by 0.5 pixel, Inf is the exact number from phase correlation. 
NimgFirstRegistration --- number of randomly sampled images to do the target computation from
NiterPrealign --- number of iterations for the target computation (iterative re-alignment of subset of frames)
smooth_time_space --- convolves raw movie with a Gaussian of specified size in specified dimensions;
                      [t]: convolve in time with gauss. of std t, [t s]: convolve in time and space,
                      [t x y]: convolve in time, and in space with an ellipse rather than circle
