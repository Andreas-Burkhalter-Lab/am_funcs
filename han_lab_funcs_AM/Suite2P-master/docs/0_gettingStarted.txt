The toolbox runs in Matlab (+ one mex file) and currently only supports tiff file inputs. To begin using the toolbox, you will need to make local copies (in a separate folder) of two included files: master_file and make_db. It is important that you make local copies of these files, otherwise updating the repository will overwrite them (and you can lose your files). The make_db file assembles a database of experiments that you would like to be processed in batch. It also adds per-session specific information that the algorithm requires such as the number of imaged planes and channels. The master_file sets general processing options that are applied to all sessions included in make_db, UNLESS the option is over-ridden in the make_db file.  The global and session-specific options are described in detail below.
