RootStorage --- the root location where the raw tiff files are  stored.
RegFileRoot --- location on local disk where to keep the registered movies in binary format. This will be loaded several times so it should ideally be an SSD drive. 
ResultsSavePath --- where to save the final results. 
DeleteBin --- deletes the binary file created to store the registered movies

All of these filepaths are completed with separate subfolders per animal and experiment, specified in the make_db file. Your data MUST be stored under a file tree of the form

\RootStorage\mouse_name\session\block\*.tif(f)

The following is a typical example of an entry in the local make_db file, which can be modelled after make_db_example. The folder structure assumed is RootStorage/mouse_name/date/expts(k) for all entries in expts(k). 

i = i+1;
db(i).mouse_name    = 'M150329_MP009'; 
db(i).date          = '2015-04-27';
db(i).expts         = [5 6]; % which experiments to process together


The output is a struct called dat which is saved into a mat file in ResultsSavePath using the same subfolder structure, under a name formatted like F_M150329_MP009_2015-04-29_plane1_Nk650. It contains all the information collected throughout the processing, and contains the fluorescence traces in dat.F.Fcell and whether a given ROI is a cell or not in dat.F.iscell. dat.stat contains information about each ROI and can be used to recover the corresponding pixels for each ROI in dat.stat.ipix. The centroid of the ROI is specified in dat.stat as well. Here is a summary of where the important results are:

cell traces are in dat.F.Fcell
neuropil traces are in dat.F.FcellNeu
neuropil subtraction coefficient is dat.cl.dcell{i}.B(3)
baseline is dat.cl.dcell{i}.B(2)
anatomical cell criterion is in dat.cl.isroi
manual overwritten cell labels are in dat.cl.iscell
dat.cl.dcell{i}.st are the deconvolved spike times (in frames)
dat.cl.dcell{i}.c  are the deconvolved amplitudes
dat.cl.dcell{i}.kernel is the estimated kernel
