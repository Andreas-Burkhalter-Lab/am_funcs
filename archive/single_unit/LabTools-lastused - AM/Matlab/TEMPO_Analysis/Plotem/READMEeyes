FILE:  READMEeyes
PATH:  /HOME/crista/matlab/eyes

The purpose of this file is to provide a brief overview of the eye 
movement analysis tools (matlab functions) that exist in this directory.

The primary program is plotem.m.  It is an interactive program that
lets the user view eye movement data and corresponding trial events and
spikes.  It requires (that is, attempts to load) the .s, .ras, .index,
and .tim and .e1h and .e1v files (these latter are eye movement data files).
To analyze data, user needs these files, and will probably want to check
the defaults script plotemdefaults.m to see if the data in question is
accounted for; this is not absolutely necessary, however, as it is possible
to enter data paths and such directly into the plotem user interface.

A more complete description of how plotem works and what it does is pending.
It calls other programs, all of which are found in this same directory.

A secondary program, getem.m, does the same things as plotem.m in terms of
loading and modifying data, but without the plotting, such that it can
be run in an automated loop when compiling data across experiments.
