%LOGGAUSS_ERR Used by LOGGAUSSFIT.
%	LOGGAUSS_ERR(q) returns the error between the data and the
%	values computed by the LOGGAUSS function.

% return the sum squared error
%NOTE; we are minimizing differences between sqrt of data and sqrt of function
%THis is because the sqrt helps to homogenize the variance of the neuronal responses
%across values of the independent variable.
