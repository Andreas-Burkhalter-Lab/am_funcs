About the frame/stack numbering in stimulus sequence encoded in the header
(".txt" accompanying the raw acquisition file by Calcim
and ".imagine" by Imagine):

1. the number is 0-based, that is, the 1st frame is "frame 0" for Calcim,
   and the first stack is "stack 0" for Imagine.

2. For Calcim:
      if stimulus timing is: v t, that means right after "frame t",
      "valve v" is opened. That is, "frame t+1" is the first frame
      that has stimulus v. In another word, the (t+2)nd frame is
      the first frame has stimlus v.
      The reason for this inconvenient numbering is that we try
      to avoid valve change during acquiring a frame.

      imphysfrom2d parses this stimulus information so that the 'stimulus'
      field in the imphys structure contains the valve number open at the
      time of image acquisition.

   For Imagine:
      if stimlulus timing is: v s, that means right after "stack s-1",
      "valve v" is opened. That is, "stack s" is the first stack
      that has "valve v". In another word, the (s+1)st stack is
      the first stack has valve v.
      The reason for this change from Calcim to Imagine is that we feel
      the way in Imagine is more natural when designing stimulus sequence.

      Matlab func imagine_stim_lookup() parses the header and returns
      the open valve for each stack, which hides the confusing details of
      stack numbering.

3. Obviously, since MATLAB is unit-offset, once you create an imphys
   structure, the first frame is indexed by 1, not zero.
