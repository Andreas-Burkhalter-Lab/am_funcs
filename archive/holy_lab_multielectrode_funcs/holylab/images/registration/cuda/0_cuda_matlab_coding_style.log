CUDA code naming style (beta)


New cuda accelerated mex code should be named basing on the corresponding
cpu mex code, if there are, by attaching a '_cuda' suffix. 
For example, for the existing mex code,
	register_mismatch_nancorr.m
the corresponding cuda accelerated code is named as
	register_mismatch_nancorr_cuda.cu
where .cu is the cuda file extension.
Also the new cuda code should be placed in a sub-folder named 'cuda'.

For brand new cuda mex code, it should be named following the
	do_some_thing_cuda.cu
style.


In Nvidia cuda runtime API, all the cuda runtime functions are named with 
'cuda' prefix, like
	cudaDoSomeThing( ).
For this reason, all the newly created cuda accelerated functions which are
used to handle cuda/gpu related computation, should be declared as
	cuda_do_some_thing()
so as to distinguish them.

Variables:

device variable starts with d_
host variable starts with h_
