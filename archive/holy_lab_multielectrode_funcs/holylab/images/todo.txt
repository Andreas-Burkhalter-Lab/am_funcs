Performance increase:
vimage allocation can be a big bottleneck, at least in 'fake' mode (accounted for ~25% of total computation time).  Could go to an STL-like method where containers are allocated with a bit of room left over, and whenever they fill up they double in size all at once.  Would have to introduce a VIMAGE_NEXT global & re-write all of the code which cares about the length of the VIMAGE list.  I don't think such a change would be all that bad, but perhaps it's not necessary, since it's a small part of any "real" processing.
Other bottlenecks: size, imclass, and MATLAB's builtin load & save functionality.  I tested to see whether MATLAB can load and save the VIMAGE_LIST faster if you first convert it to a pure structure, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

It looks like roidraw is not used---delete?

May want to change roistruct to separate tforms from ROIs, so that time and space are separately handled. But it would be easier to leave things as-is....
