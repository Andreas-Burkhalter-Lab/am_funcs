function xout = meanshift1d(xin,thresh)
% MEANSHIFT1D: cluster points in one dimension by mean-shift algorithm
% Given an input set of points xin, each point is iteratively moved to the
% center of mass of all points within a given distance of that point.
% When points converge to a final position, the algorithm terminates.
%
% Syntax:
%   xout = meanshift1d(xin,thresh)
% where
%   xin is a vector containing the initial set of locations;
%   thresh is the distance threshold to define the "local neighborhood";
% and
%   xout is a vector containing the final locations; the point starting
%     at xin(j) moves to xout(j).
%
% This uses the full point-movement algorithm; it's O(N^2) if your
% threshold is large enough that much of the sample is encompased, but
% smaller thresholds result in O(N) behavior.
