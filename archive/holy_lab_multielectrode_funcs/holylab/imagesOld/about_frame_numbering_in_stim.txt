About the frame numbering in stimulus sequence encoded in the header
(".txt" accompanying the raw acquisition file):

1. the number is 0-based, that is, the 1st frame is "frame 0"

2. if stimulus timing is: v t, that means right after "frame t",
   "valve v" is opened. That is, "frame t+1" is the first frame
   that has stimulus v. In another word, the (t+2)nd frame is
   the first frame has stimlus v.
   The reason for this inconvenient numbering is that we try
   to avoid valve change during acquiring a frame.


imphysfrom2d parses this stimulus information so that the 'stimulus'
field in the imphys structure contains the valve number open at the
time of image acquisition.

Obviously, since MATLAB is unit-offset, once you create an imphys
structure, the first frame is indexed by 1, not zero.
