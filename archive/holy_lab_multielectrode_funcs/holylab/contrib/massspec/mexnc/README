MexNC 

MexNC is an interface between MATLAB and NetCDF files.  What's provided
here is the C code for building the mexnc mex-file on your platform as
well as several helper routines and wrappers.  The 2.0.x release is
known to be compatible with NetCDF versions 3.6.2 and below.


NETCDF TOOLBOX
=======================================================================
The Netcdf Toolbox is not part of this download.  Go check 
http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net for it.


Standard Install Instructions:
========================================================================
If your download already contains a mex-file and if you don't use 
windows, you may already be set.  Just add the path to this directory 
to your matlab path and give it a go.  If you need to compile the mex-
file, read down below in the section "Compiling Your Own".  But first,
some platform-specific notes for windows users.


Compiling your Own:
========================================================================
    You shouldn't have to do this unless a mex-file for your platform
    is not already present in the private directory.  If you do wish
    to compile your own version, look in the src directory.

    If you are running 32-bit windows, then in the win32 directory is 
    a file called netcdf.dll.  You will need this in to be placed onto
    your system path in order for the mex-file to work.  It's easiest
    if you just install it into ${MATLABROOT}/bin/win32 but you can 
    choose another location if you take these additional steps.

    On windows XP, you can find and set your system path like so...

        Start => Settings => Control Panel => System => Advanced =>
        Environment Variables => System Variables

    Then select PATH, and either edit it to include the path to the 
    netcdf.dll file, or put the netcdf.dll file somewhere on that path.
    You should then reboot.

    You should remove any old version of the netcdf.dll.



OPeNDAP
=======================================================================
If you wish to use an opendap-enabled version of mexnc, then you have to
compile it yourself.  Take a look at the online notes at 
http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/opendap/ for further details.
