First of all, please don't ask me about the Netcdf Toolbox.  Thank you.

Standard Install Instructions:
========================================================================
If your download already contains a mex-file and if you don't use 
windows, you may already be set.  Just add the path to this directory 
to your matlab path and give it a go.  If you need to compile the mex-
file, read down below in the section "Compiling Your Own".  But first,
some platform-specific notes for windows users.



Platform-Specific Notes:
========================================================================
  If your platform isn't listed here, then either there aren't any
  problems with the standard installation or nobody has reported any
  yet...


  Windows
  ======================================================================
    In the win32 directory is a file called netcdf.dll.  You will
    need this in order to run mexnc.  Please install it somewhere on
    your system path or just add it to your path.  That's your SYSTEM 
    PATH, not your MATLAB PATH.

    On windows XP, you can find and set your system path like so...

        Start => Settings => Control Panel => System => Advanced =>
        Environment Variables => System Variables

    Then select PATH, and either edit it to include the path to the 
    netcdf.dll file, or put the netcdf.dll file somewhere on that path.
    You should then reboot.

    You should remove any old version of the netcdf.dll.

    If you wish to compile your own windows mex-file, please look in
    the win32 directory for the proper m-file which which to build.

Compiling your Own:
========================================================================
If you need to roll your own on UNIX or unix-like systems, first locate
a file called "mexopts.sh" on your system.  It should be located
under your matlab bin directory.  For example, on my linux system,
matlab is installed in /opt/matlab, and the location of mexopts.sh is
/opt/matlab/bin/mexopts.sh .  So copy that file into the directory into
which you unpacked mexnc.  

You then need to edit it, inserting the following lines in down at the
bottom in the "Architecture independent lines" section.  

    NETCDF="/path/to/netcdf"
    EXTRA_CFLAGS="-I${NETCDF}/include"
    EXTRA_CLIBS="-L${NETCDF}/lib -lnetcdf "
    CFLAGS="-g $CFLAGS ${EXTRA_CFLAGS}"
    CLIBS="$CLIBS ${EXTRA_CLIBS} "

Just change the value of NETCDF to reflect the netcdf installation
location on your system.

Then, from the command line prompt, type

    make

The result of this should be a mex-file called "mexnc.mex___", where the
"___" is replaced by a suffix suitable to your platform (e.g. "glx" for
linux, "mac" for Mac OS X, etc).  

If compiling for windows, please take a look at the m-files
win32*.m.  They require Microsoft Visual C++ compiler version 7.1
and Matlab 7 (sp1) and single threaded NetCDF 3.6.1 library (w/ large
file support), but maybe you can get it to work for other variations.

You will need to already have NetCDF installed on your system before
attempting to compile mexnc.

Make sure you add the directory into which this file was unpacked to
your matlab path.  If you also dowload the netcdf_toolbox, make sure
that mexnc precedes the netcdf_toolbox in your matlab path.
