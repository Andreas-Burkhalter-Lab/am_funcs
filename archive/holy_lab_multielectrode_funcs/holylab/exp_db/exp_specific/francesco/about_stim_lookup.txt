echo line is of format:
notation = matlab_expression

where notation is francesco's stimulus notation (i.e. valve labels);
matlab_expression is matlab expressions which will be eval-ed. 
The resulting variable "stim" has the stimulus info.
If a field is missing, the default value is:
    category: urine_whole
    concentration: 1
    conc_unit: 'fold'
    duration: NaN
    user_tag: ''
    strain: 'Balb/cJ'
    sex: 'F'
    procedure: ''

note that field 'identity' must be there.

There are two additional functions to supply different defaults:
stimdefaults_ud_francesco: for urine-derived (ud) stimuli
stimdefaults_syn_francesco: for synthetic (syn) stimuli

When multiple tubes of the "same thing" are used (e.g., Ringer's1 and
Ringer's2), indicate the '1' or '2' in the user_tag field and save the
identity field for it's nominal identity (which for Ringer's is simply
'', given the category 'negative_control').

A question: is having a 'peptide' category useful?  If so, would it
only be used in cases where the peptide sequence is the name (e.g.,
'SYFPEITHI'), or would it also be used for others (e.g., ESP1)?  Or
might 'synthetic_compound' cover everything? Right now 'peptide' is
being used for all peptides.
