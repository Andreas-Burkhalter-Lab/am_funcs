What is what

    zsguo
----------------------
* engine: the core of the experiment database. 
   Very little is assumed:
     - each entry (a database record) is a matlab struct
     - the struct has at least one field: id
   So we can still use the same core interface if either
     - we change the backend to a real dbms
     - we change what fields are there in each entry

   To make your code survive those changes, please don't work on file
   /usr/lab/exp_db/*/*.xdb directly, instead following should be used:
     - query:  search_xdb()
     - insert: save_xdb_entry()
     - delete: delete_xdb_entry()
     - update: save_xdb_entry() (by specifying an id)

* content_specific: well, this is maybe a bad naming. Basically what 
   inside this dir specifies the field requirement suitable for our lab.

* convenient: current a few wrappers around search_xdb() to make life easier.

* exp_specific: holds experiment-specific and investigator-specific scripts
   and callbacks.

* general_utils: supporting funcs that can also be used outside xdb context.

* operators: the operators(func handles) useful for specifying conditions
   in query_callback_and().
