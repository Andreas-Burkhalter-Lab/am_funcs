Read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

This directory has a Contents.m file, which means that the "helpwin"
function under MATLAB will give you hyperlinked help for the functions
in this directory.  Put this directory somewhere on your MATLAB path.

There are four example files, which may be helpful in learning how to
use these functions:
  aitest: Tests asynchronous analog input.  This is the most thoroughly
    refined of the examples, and is therefore more complex but also more
    flexible.  It may even run without you having to tweak any of the
    parameters in the file.
  aotest: Tests analog output
  aiaotest: Tests simultaneous input & output.  I think this won't run
    (I haven't maintained it since I changed some function names), but it
    may be useful as a starting point.
  diotest: Tests digital I/O

For some things missing from this collection, see the file comedi_missing.m.
