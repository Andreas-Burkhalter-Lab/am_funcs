To install the comedi_matlab bindings, carry out the following steps:

1. Move this directory to the place you want to keep these MEX files;
update the MATLAB path if necessary.

2. Edit Config to set parameters for your system: in particular, the
MATLAB home directory and the location you wish to use to install the
library.

3. make lib

4. make lib_install (must be done as root)

5. make clean; make allmex 
(Note: many functions depend on commat_util.c, yet for some reason I
can't figure out how to get make to recompile this file when it
changes.  I recommend a make clean; make allmex to make sure that
commat_util is updated properly.  Any suggestions for fixing this
behavior are welcome.)
